The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, 
low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time. 
The goal of the SDLC is to produce superior software that meets and exceeds all customer expectations and demands.
The SDLC defines and outlines a detailed plan with stages, or phases, that each encompass their own process and deliverables. 
Adherence to the SDLC enhances development speed and minimizes project risks and costs associated with alternative methods of production.
